# Algerian_Forest_Fires
Algeria, like many countries, faces the constant threat of forest fires. These wildfires not only pose a significant environmental challenge but also impact lives and livelihoods. To address this critical issue, I embarked on a data-driven journey to gain insights and make predictions.
Data Collection:
I gathered historical data on factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, along with records of past forest fires in Algeria. This rich dataset became the foundation for our analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA unveiled fascinating patterns and correlations within the data. I visualized key insights, identifying when and where forest fires are most likely to occur. It was crucial to understand the underlying factors driving these events.
Predictive Modeling:
Using machine learning algorithms, I built predictive models to forecast the likelihood of future forest fires. These models take into account various environmental variables to provide valuable early warnings.
Results and Implications:
The predictive models achieved impressive accuracy rates, providing authorities with a valuable tool for proactive fire management. This project holds great potential in helping mitigate the devastating impact of forest fires in Algeria.
